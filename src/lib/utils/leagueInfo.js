  <p>The 2025 Season Is Dead and My Super Team Choked</p>
  <p>Gentlemen, Lady, and Russell,</p>
  <p>As your Commissioner, it is my distinct displeasure to announce that the 2025 season has finally been put out of its misery. Another year of our lives has been wasted staring at waiver wires, agonizing over FAAB budgets, and pretending we know more about football than actual NFL general managers.It was a season of highs, lows, and whatever the hell Russell was doing. But in the end, there can be only one Champion.</p>
  <p>THE CHAMPION’S CUP WINNER: JACKY KLINEBUB (DADDY)</p>
  <p>Gentlemen, bow down. Jacky is our 2025 League Champion.</p>
  <p>Let us put this performance into perspective. While the rest of you frittatas were struggling to set a lineup before Thursday Night Football, Jacky was literally creating human life. She gave birth to her second child and still managed to dismantle my Super Team on the way to her first title, winning Final Fantasy Football III.</p>
  <p>She balanced raising a new baby with managing a juggernaut roster. It was not just Josh Allen (QB1); she had the audacity to roster Drake Maye (QB2), effectively cornering the market on elite quarterback play. While Mark was running a retirement home, Jacky was deploying a hit squad of Kyren Williams, Josh Jacobs, Kenneth Walker, and Quinshon Judkins.</p>
  <p>She beat me in the Championship game by 0.37 points (146.12 to 145.75). It was a razor-thin margin, a photo finish, the kind of victory that proves every single yard counts. Jacky, the title and the confetti belong to you. Congratulations on ripping the trophy from my hands with the ruthlessness of a champion.</p>
  <p>THE RUNNER-UP: ME (MAGIC CITY MAGES)</p>
  <p>I will take my defeat with the grace and dignity of a man who knows he swung for the fences. I built a roster that looked like a salary cap violation: Patrick Mahomes, Bijan Robinson, Jahmyr Gibbs, Puka Nacua, Justin Jefferson. It was beautiful. It was a work of art.</p>
  <p>And it was not enough.</p>
  <p>I am not the Buffalo Bills. I have tasted glory before. I built the perfect machine. I had the star power. I had the arrogance. I went undefeated in spirit if not in record. And I got punch-drunk on my own hype and lost in the final seconds to a sideline catch that wasn’t. I went all in, trading away every single one of my 2026 draft picks to win this year. I have no 1st, no 2nd, no 3rd, no 4th. I mortgaged my entire draft class for a second ring, and I fell short by less than half a point. I accept my second-place finish, and I will now retreat to my forever unclean shame cave to contemplate my empty draft board.</p>
  <p>THE SACKO / KING OF TRASH: RUSSELL FEDELE</p>
  <p>Let us turn our attention to the toilet bowl. KFC Pound Town. Russell, you secured the King of Last Place title in the loser’s bracket, falling to Andy Buck in the ultimate game of shame, 101.86 to 109.98. That’s twice in the last three seasons. Trust the process?</p>
  <p>Your roster construction was a choice. You drafted Tyreek Hill, who decided to age in dog years this season (WR108). Your star receiver was Jauan Jennings. You relied on Zach Charbonnet and Rico Dowdle to carry the load behind Ashton Jeanty. You are the Sacko. The only silver lining is you hold the 1.01 pick. Do not screw this up. You need help so badly it hurts to look at your depth chart.</p>
  <p>THE REST OF THE FIELD (A ROLL CALL OF FAILURE)</p>
  <p>3rd Place: Werewolves of London (Taylor Chapman) You beat Steve to take the bronze. You have a solid young core with Jayden Daniels and Bo Nix appearing to be the QBs of the future, and Drake London finally living up to the hype. But let us be honest, Taylor, nobody remembers who finished third. Enjoy your participation trophy and the 3rd place cash.</p>
  <p>4th Place: No Nombre Hombres (Steve Dominguez) Steve, you have CeeDee Lamb and Amon-Ra St. Brown. You have Jared Goff and Baker Mayfield putting up top 12 numbers. On paper, you are a contender. In reality, you lost the 3rd place game and walked away with nothing. That inaugural championship is sinking into the horizon.</p>
  <p>5th Place: JalenHuluHasLiveSports (Mark Becker) Mark, your team is a retirement home. Derrick Henry, Alvin Kamara, Saquon Barkley, Jonathan Taylor. Do you draft based on 2020 Pro Bowl rosters? Your running back room smells like Bengay and butterscotch candies. It is impressive longevity, but the cliff is coming, and you are driving a bus full of geriatrics right toward it.</p>
  <p>6th Place: Got Christians, no Lions (Jack Becker) You had Christian McCaffrey (RB1, 365 points). Having CMC and finishing 6th is essentially malpractice. You made the playoffs, but your team ran out of gas immediately. You need to figure out what to do with your aging assets before Aaron Rodgers finally retires for the 15th time.</p>
  <p>7th Place: The Door Abides (Alex Somer) You are the definition of middle of the pack. You have Trevor Lawrence and Breece Hall, which is a solid foundation, but banking on Travis Hunter (WR97) to save you was a gamble that did not pay off this year. Finishing 7th is fantasy purgatory—not good enough to win, not bad enough for the 1.01.</p>
  <p>8th Place: Letterkenny Irish (Jon Gibbs) You are the Smaug of the league, hoarding three first-round picks (1.03, 1.05, 1.12). You sacrificed the present for the future, starting Jaxson Dart and Tyler Shough at Quarterback. We get it, you are rebuilding. Now that you have the capital, let us see if you can actually draft, or if you will just draft three more WR3s to go with Cedric Tillman.</p>
  <p>9th Place: The Buck Stops Here (Andy Buck) Andy, you narrowly avoided the Sacko, but let us be honest: your roster is a MASH unit. You roster Joe Mixon (who played zero games) and Nick Chubb (who is barely holding on). You are not managing a fantasy team; you are managing a physical therapy clinic. Lamar Jackson can only do so much when his supporting cast is in traction.</p>
  <p>10th Place: Like a Good Naber... (Jeff Chapman) Jeff, watching your team is like watching a Ferrari engine inside a go-kart. You have Ja'Marr Chase—an elite weapon—but you are throwing to him with Brock Purdy and Justin Fields. And losing Malik Nabers to that ACL tear was the final nail in your coffin. You are a Quarterback away from terrifying us all, but right now, you are just terrifying yourself.</p>
  <p>11th Place: Chubb’s Last Chub RIP Joe (Nick Klinebub) You have the 1.02. Your team name mourns Joe Burrow, and frankly, we all mourned your season. Between Burrow injuries and Anthony Richardson losing his job to injury and Danny Dimes6, you never stood a chance. You have Rome Odunze and Jaylen Waddle, but you desperately need a Running Back who is not eligible for AARP benefits (looking at you, Aaron Jones).</p>
  <p>LOOKING AHEAD
The 2025 season is dead. The 2026 Draft is coming. Russell is on the clock. I am on the couch with zero picks, watching highlight reels of the team that almost won.
Jacky, raise the trophy high. You earned it.</p>
  <p>Sincerely, Edward Martinez, Commissioner, Final Fantasy Football</p>
